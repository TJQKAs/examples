Under the proposals, the amount of money paid to home owners and businesses producing electricity from roof-top solar and small wind turbines will be limited from January 2016. Subsidy schemes could be closed to new entrants from the start of next year. Ministers want to ensure that consumers who pay for the schemes through their bills get the best deal possible. They admitted in July that spending on renewable energy schemes was set to be higher than expected. </i>'},
